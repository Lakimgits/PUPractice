    <p class="general_text" id="PU_description">
        Paladins are elite warriors. Imperial Guards turned into unmatched fighters in service to the Emperor. The Paladins take part in exclusive combat trainings that allows them to be much more knowledgeable and skilled than any common Imperial Guard. That makes them incredible allies, and dangerous foes on the battlefield.

            <h2 class="titles">Green Cross</h2>

            <p class="crosses_text">
                Paladins of the Green Cross are named “Protectors”, and they are trained to keep other Imperial Guards alive when guarding a protectee or during battle. The Protectors are experts at health rotation, and know when to fall back and when to protect an ally from the enemy. They are trained by the Master of the Green Cross to defend others against attacks and to stay alive for a long time by knowing when to back off and when to join the fray again.

        <div id="red_cross">
            <h2 class="titles">Red Cross</h2>

            <p class="crosses_text">
                Paladins of the Red Cross are named “Blades”. The Blades specialize in taking out the enemy head-on with great skill in combat and strategies. The Blades are tasked with keeping raiders at bay by fighting them away from the protectee. During battles, members of the Red Cross flank the enemy and push them into the other Imperial Guards. They stay alive for long due to their skill and training in health rotations, while killing enemies with their exceptional skill in aggressive combat.

        <div id="blue_cross">
            <h2 class="titles">Blue Cross</h2>

            <p class="crosses_text">
                Paladins of the Blue Cross excel at the use of war axe to crush the enemy and take them by surprise. They act as the shock troopers and will often be seen working in pair with a swordsman to deal insane amounts of damage to the enemy in a short amount of time. They are called “Berserkers”, and with good reason. Their main duty is to use their powerful war axes to decimate any and all enemies on the battlefield, securing victory for the Imperial Guard or keeping our protectees alive.
